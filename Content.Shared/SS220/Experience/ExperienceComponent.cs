// # What happens and when
// 1. We start studying skill -> we add starting info into Skills and sets StudyingProgress in 0
//      *setting StudyingProgress checks if next (for init next is actually a starting) can be start studying
//         but if somehow it is passed, so you can progress
// 2. When we hit StudyingProgress equal maximum (1) we progress in one sublevel (0,0,1) -> (0,1,0)
// 3. Hitting StudyingProgress maximum and sublevel maximum (s_m) we progress one level in tree
//                                                      which also calls Skill to be acquired (0, s_m, 1) -> (1, 0, 0)
//      * yeah again we have field named CanEndStudying which can block that progress
// 4. Repeat to have fun!
//
// In addition to have some image in mind lets use:
// [xxxx][xx|o][ooo][oo]
//  its describe SkillTreeExperienceInfo = (1, 2)
//  tree have 4 skills in it with maxSublevels 4 3 3 and 2.
//  | shows StudyingProgress
// it is possible to have images:
//  [xx|][oo] <= this means that 1 skill cant be studied  SkillTreeExperienceInfo is (0, 2)
//  [xx]| <= this will happen if we ended tree SkillTreeExperienceInfo is (1, null)
//  [xx][|00] <= this !can! mean that we earned 1 skill but 2 banned from studying SkillTreeExperienceInfo is (1, 0)
